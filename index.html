					Hi. Today I would like to talk about Cross-site request forgery.
					Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an
					attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform.
					It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent
					different websites from interfering with each other.

					How does CSRF work?
					For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:

			<section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>
				<h2 data-id="code-title">How does CSRF work?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A relevant action.</li>				
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					A relevant action.
					There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce.
					This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) 
					or any action on user-specific data 
					(such as changing the user's own password).
				</aside>
			  </section>

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>
				<h2 data-id="code-title">How does CSRF work?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A relevant action.</li>
					<li>Cookie-based session handling. </li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					Cookie-based session handling.
					Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, 
					and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. 
					There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

					<li>A relevant action.</li>
					<li>Cookie-based session handling. </li>
					<li>No unpredictable request parameters. </li>		
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					No unpredictable request parameters.
					The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess.
					 For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.
				</aside>

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>			
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
					POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
					Host: vulnerable-website.com
					Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
					Content-Length: 30
					Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE					
					email=wiener@normal-user.com
							</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					For example, suppose an application contains a function that lets the user change the email address on their account.
					When a user performs this action, they make an HTTP request like the following:
				</aside>
			  </section>

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>				
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
					<html>
						<body>
							<form action="https://v-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
								<input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
							</form>
							<script>
							//document.forms[0].submit();
							</script>
						</body>
					</html>
							</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					This meets the conditions required for CSRF:
					The action of changing the email address on a user's account is of interest to an attacker. Following this action, the attacker will typically be able to trigger a password reset and take full control of the user's account.
					The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
					The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action.
					With these conditions in place, the attacker can construct a web page containing the following HTML:
				</aside>

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>			
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>					
					<img src="http://example.com/bank.php/?action=transfer&target=
					attacker_account">

							</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					In the case of CSRF based on GET requests, the attacker can simply use an image tag (or any other tag that allows for cross-site requests) on a malicious page:
					When the user visits the page with the above image tag (for example, after clicking a malicious link), the user’s browser tries to open the image but instead makes a GET request to the targeted site, thus performing a malicious action while logged into the user’s account. 
					Assuming that the user is authenticated on example.com, the web application will be unable to differentiate between a legitimate user request and a malicious request, since they are both sent from the same browser.

				<h3 data-id="code-title">Common defences against CSRF</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Nowadays, successfully finding and exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities often involves bypassing anti-CSRF measures deployed by the target website, the victim's browser, or both. 
							The most common defenses you'll encounter are as follows:
				</aside>
			  </section>
			  
			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>			
				<ul>
					<li>CSRF tokens.</li>		
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">                   
					A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client.
					When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request.
					This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.
				</aside>
			  </section>

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>	
				<ul>
					<li>CSRF tokens.</li>
					<li>SameSite cookies. </li>			
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					 SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites.
					 As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site.
					 Since 2021, Chrome enforces SameSite restrictions by default.
					 As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.

			  <section data-background-color="#00008b" data-auto-animate>		
				<ul>
					<li>CSRF tokens.</li>
					<li>SameSite cookies. </li>
					<li>Referer-based validation. </li>		
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					Referer-based validation - Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain.
					This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.
